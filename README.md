# Austin.gov 
The City of Austin's [Office of Design and Delivery](http://odd.austintexas.io/) is in the process of rebuilding the Cityâ€™s website to improve delivery of our services to Austin residents. The new site, [Austin.gov](http://alpha.austin.gov/), is an evolving platform that will grow, adapt, and improve with user needs.

This repo is used for centralized project management of the project for the following teams:
  - [Content](https://github.com/cityofaustin/techstack#boards?labels=team%3A%20content)
  - [Design + Research](https://github.com/cityofaustin/techstack#boards?labels=team%3A%20design%2Fresearch&repos=118780243)
  - [Dev](https://github.com/cityofaustin/techstack#boards?labels=team%3A%20dev)
  - [Product](https://github.com/cityofaustin/techstack#boards?labels=team%3A%20product)

This includes work related to:
  - [Janis](https://github.com/cityofaustin/janis) - Austin.gov's resident-facing interface for service delivery
  - [Joplin](https://github.com/cityofaustin/joplin) - Austin.gov's staff-facing interface for content creation and maintenance
  - [Animal Services Foster Form Prototype](https://github.com/cityofaustin/prototypeform)

Our team is using Zenhub for agile project management. In order to view our Kanban board (aka Trello-style), you need to download the [Zenhub extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) for your browser. See our guide to how we use Zenhub [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HUC70Tlf41XKe_ESRJMWcPlpTdpiKeld_lTRNoLC7Y4/edit#slide=id.p).

## Adding an issue
(needs work: what we like to see)

## Grooming

In preparation for every Sprint Planning, the backlog of issues needs to be groomed. Issues that are likely to be pulled into one of the next few sprints should have
  - One and only one _Team_ label - unless it is a meeting
  - At least one _Feature_, _Content Type_, or _Resource_ label
  - T-shirt size

If completion of an issue is blocked by another issue, add a dependency:

If the blocking issue isn't in Github yet, create it and make sure to add the appropriate _Team_ label and then add the dependency.
