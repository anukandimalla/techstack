name: Content debt 
about: Use this template when you've published content on Joplin that should be changed or improved in the future when we have new functionality/feature available.

Make sure to add the label "Content debt." If available, add the appropriate "Content type" or "Feature" label.

**What type of content debt is it? Check if content debt is lack of:** 
- [ ] Missing feature
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Consistency/adherence to the style guide
- [ ] Clarity of ownership
- [ ] Findability
- [ ] Maintenance schedule (when does content get updated and by whom?)
- [ ] Availability (ex. Pdf doesnâ€™t equal accessibility)
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Containment (presented as data set rather than a paragraph)
- [ ] Usability (How do users rate content on clarity? Does it help get users ahead or confuse them? Does content create more work for users and annoy them?) 

**What is the URL?**

**Have you documented this via the author notes field in Joplin?**
- [ ] Yes!
- [ ] No, but I'll do it now
