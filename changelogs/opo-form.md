## OPO Media Push [2.0] - 2019-03-25
### Added 
- New Date Picker. It’s more human-readable and screenreader accessible.
- Warning modal that pops up when you switch languages. This prevents users from accidentally deleting all of their form data.
- Users have the option of entering their email after the form has been submitted. This is an extra touchpoint to reach out to users who did not want to give contact information earlier in the process.

## Changed
- Location Picker (map). It’s now on its own page to draw more focus to it. It also has zoom buttons, and some features that confused users have been removed (e.g. 3-D mode).

## Fixed
- Broken links have been fixed.
- Phone numbers are now links that mobile users can call.
- Various minor styling and copy improvements.
- Various UI/functionality bugs, including translation/localization issues
